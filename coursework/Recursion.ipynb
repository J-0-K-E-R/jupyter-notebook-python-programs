    "\n",
    "The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples  Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.\n",

    "Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how recursion works. A recursive function calls itself. As you youâ€™d imagine such a process would repeat indefinitely if not stopped by some condition. This condition is known as base condition. A base condition is must in every recursive programs otherwise it will continue to execute forever like an infinite loop.\n",
